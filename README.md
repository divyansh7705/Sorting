# Sorting

## Aim
 To implement fundamental sorting algorithms—Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. 
 
## Theory

Sorting is a critical operation in computer science, allowing for the organization of data in a specified order. Efficient sorting is essential for optimizing search operations and data analysis. All the three algorithms have unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses:

1. **Bubble Sort**: This straightforward algorithm repeatedly traverses the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. It’s like repeatedly passing through a row of books and swapping two that are in the wrong order until everything is lined up correctly.

2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted section. It continuously selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted section and moves it to the end of the sorted section. Imagine picking the smallest item from a pile, setting it aside, and repeating this process until the pile is empty.

3. **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds a sorted array one element at a time, inserting each new element into its appropriate position within the already sorted part. Think of it like sorting playing cards; you take one card from the deck and insert it into the correct position among the cards already laid out in order.

## Algorithms for Bubble Sort

1. Start at the beginning of the array.
2. Compare the first two elements.
3. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat the process.
5. Continue until the end of the array is reached.
6. Repeat the entire process until no swaps are needed.


## Algorithm for Selection Sort
1. Start with the entire array as unsorted.
2. Find the smallest element in the unsorted part.
3. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
4. Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted parts one element to the right.
5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.


## Algorithm for Insertion Sort
1. Start with the first element as the sorted portion.
2. Take the next element from the unsorted portion.
3. Compare it with elements in the sorted portion and find its correct position.
4. Shift all larger elements one position to the right to make space.
5. Insert the element in its correct position.
6. Repeat until the array is fully sorted.

## Conclusion
In this experiment sorting were performed.
